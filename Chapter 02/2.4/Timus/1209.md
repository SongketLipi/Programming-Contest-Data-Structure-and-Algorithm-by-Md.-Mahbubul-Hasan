### Prerequisite:
* Knowledge of [Triangular Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number).

### Solution:

Let's take a sequence:

`1101001000` (from 10<sup>0</sup>, appended upto 10<sup>3</sup>)
<br><br>
Let us observe the positions of `1` by appending in such a way:

|Place|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Digit|1|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|

<br><br>
Let us now try to determine the position of `1`s,

If we observe the positon of `1`s, their position in this kind of appended string is actually :

  ( (__T__<sub>Number of 0s</sub>) + __1__ )-th positon.
    Where, __T<sub>i</sub>__ denotes the i-th triangular number. 
   
<br>
For example:

In case of the `1` in `7`th position, it was obtained by appending __10<sup>3</sup>__. 

Number of `0`s for (10<sup>3</sup> ) = __3__.

 __T<sub>3</sub>__ = 6 and (__T<sub>3</sub>__ +__1__) = __7__, which is the correct position of `1`.
